## Part 1 ##
### Find Reversed Words ###
* The reversed word: 'evil' -> 'live', 'saw' -> 'was'...
* Input Data: the file 'words' built-in linux.
* Output Data: the files 'result_py' and 'result_c'. (The output format is required to be the same as the format in file 'words', but not to be ordered.)
* Requirements: you need to ensure that there are five files at least in your folder.('words', 'find_reversed_words.py', 'find_reversed_words.c', 'run.sh', 'readme.md'); And assume that your runtime environment includes GCC-4.8.2+, Python2.7 and supports the Posix standard(you have no sudo privilege), and it can run automatically after typing './run.sh' and pressing enter. The compliation of the file 'find_reversed_words.c' should be later than the running of the script 'find_reversed_words.py' and earlier than the creating of the file 'result_py'.
